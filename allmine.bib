ABSTRACT="Healthcare network and computing infrastructure is rapidly changing from
closed environments to open environments that incorporate new devices and
new application scenarios. Home-based healthcare is such an example of
leveraging pervasive sensors and analyzing sensor data (often in real-time)
to guide therapy or intervene. In this paper, we address the challenges in
regulatory compliance when designing and deploying healthcare applications
on a heterogeneous cloud environment. We propose the CareNet framework,
consisting of a set of APIs and secure data transmission mechanisms, to
facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare services running on
the software-defined infrastructure (SDI). This work is a collaboration
among computer scientists, medical researchers, healthcare IT and
healthcare providers, and its goal is to reduce the gap between the
availability of SDI and meeting regulatory compliance in healthcare
applications. Our prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the framework
and serves as testbed for novel experimental studies of emerging healthcare
applications."

	TITLE="{P4GPU:} Acceleration of Programmable Data Plane Using a {CPU-GPU}
	Heterogeneous Architecture",
	BOOKTITLE="2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on High Performance Switching and
	Routing (HPSR)",
	series = {IEEE HPSR '16},
	ADDRESS="Yokohama, Japan",
	DAYS=14,

	pages={168-175}, 
	KEYWORDS="Programmable Data Plane; Heterogeneous Architecture; Packet Processing; P4",
	ABSTRACT={The programmability of the network data plane has become one of the most
	desirable features within the context of software defined networks, with P4
	serving as a domain-specific language for defining data plane processing.
	In this work, we are motivated to address the challenges of mapping a P4
	defined data plane to a heterogeneous programmable hardware architecture
	consisting of both a CPU and a GPU, which includes a salient parallel SIMD
	architecture for processing network flows. We first design a toolset that
	can be used to map a P4 program onto the proposed architecture. We then
	optimize the GPU kernel designs for {"}match-action{"} primitives and
	present latency-hiding techniques to reduce the overheads of CPU/GPU
	communication. In addition, load balancing is investigated to maximize the
	utilization of CPU and GPU resources. Our toolset and optimizations allow a
	P4 program to render promising performance on the given heterogeneous
	architecture. Specifically, the experimental results collected on our
	prototype systems show that the automatically configured GPU kernels
	achieve scalable lookup and classification speeds with 420 million IP
	lookups per second, and more than 60 million classifications per second
	(for 4K firewall rules).},
